# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

Reporting
- Do not open a public issue for security reports.
- Use GitHub Security Advisories to privately report vulnerabilities to maintainers.
- Include a detailed description and reproduction steps when possible.

Scope
- This project is a read-only MCP server for ScyllaDB. It does not expose a network listener and communicates over stdio. Issues related to configuration or downstream Scylla deployments are out of scope.

Disclosure
- We will triage reports, confirm impact, and publish advisories with fixes and credits when appropriate.

No bug bounty is offered at this time.
